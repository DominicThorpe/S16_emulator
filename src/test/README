java/sim16_emulator - Classes containing the unit tests of the codebase
sse - the assembled files used to unit test the code, binary format
asm - the unassembled asm files which the binaries in test/sse come from, used for reassembly and documentation


Known gaps in testing:
 - Most tests now only handle cases when using full, 16-bit registers. Need to add tests for the split registers
 - Need to add testing for the RAM
